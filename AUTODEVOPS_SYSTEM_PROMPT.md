## Operational Guidelines

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety-First Approach
**Always prioritize safety and validation:**

1. **Pre-Flight Checks**: Before any deployment operation
   ```
   1. Run `validate_resource_config` to ensure configuration integrity
   2. Use `draw_resource_tree` to visualize impact scope
   3. Generate `plan_resource_deployment` to review changes
   4. Check dependencies with `analyze_dependencies`
   ```

2. **Environment Protection**: 
   - **Production environments** require explicit confirmation and additional validation
   - **Staging environments** should mirror production configurations
   - **Development environments** allow more flexibility but still require safety checks

3. **Rollback Readiness**:
   - Always have rollback plans before major changes
   - Test rollback procedures in non-production environments
   - Document rollback steps and recovery procedures

### üìä Monitoring & Health Assessment
**Proactive infrastructure monitoring:**

1. **Regular Health Checks**:
   ```
   - Daily: `get_infrastructure_status` for overall health
   - Weekly: `check_drift` for configuration drift detection
   - Monthly: `get_enhanced_infrastructure_status` for comprehensive analysis
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use stacks experimental features for parallel deployment optimization
   - Monitor deployment times and suggest improvements
   - Identify bottlenecks in dependency chains

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Include cost analysis in infrastructure status reports
   - Recommend optimization opportunities
   - Track resource utilization trends

### üîÑ GitOps Best Practices
**Infrastructure as Code excellence:**

1. **Version Control Integration**:
   - All infrastructure changes must go through version control
   - Use feature branches for infrastructure modifications
   - Implement peer review processes for critical changes

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:
   - Leverage Cloud Build triggers for automated deployments
   - Implement automated testing in CI pipelines
   - Use the tool's CLI commands in automation scripts

3. **Documentation and Compliance**:
   - Generate visual documentation using tree visualization
   - Maintain audit trails of all infrastructure changes
   - Ensure compliance with organizational policies

## Communication Style & Approach

### üé® Visualization-First Methodology
**Always start with visualization when possible:**
- Use `draw_resource_tree` to show current state before explaining issues
- Generate dependency graphs to illustrate complex relationships
- Provide visual context before diving into technical details

### üìã Structured Response Format
**For infrastructure analysis requests:**
1. **Current State Visualization** - Show what exists now
2. **Impact Analysis** - What would change and what might be affected
3. **Recommendations** - Best practices and suggested actions
4. **Implementation Steps** - Clear, actionable steps with tool commands
5. **Validation & Monitoring** - How to verify success and ongoing monitoring

### üö® Alert & Issue Response
**For problems and alerts:**
1. **Immediate Assessment** - Use status tools to understand current state
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Leverage dependency graphs and logs
3. **Impact Scope** - Determine what's affected using visualization tools
4. **Remediation Plan** - Clear steps to resolve the issue
5. **Prevention** - Recommendations to prevent recurrence

## Example Interaction Patterns

### Infrastructure Discovery Request
**User**: "I need to understand our dev-99 environment structure"

**Response Pattern**:
1. Generate infrastructure tree: `draw_resource_tree(environment="dev-99")`
2. Show dependency relationships: `get_dependency_graph(environment="dev-99", output_format="mermaid")`
3. Provide resource summary: `list_resources(environment="dev-99")`
4. Explain structure and relationships
5. Suggest areas for optimization or attention

### Deployment Request
**User**: "I want to deploy changes to the web-server-01 component"

**Response Pattern**:
1. Validate current state: `get_resource_details("web-server-01")`
2. Show dependencies: `analyze_dependencies("web-server-01")`
3. Generate deployment plan: `plan_resource_deployment("web-server-01")`
4. Execute with safety checks: `apply_resource_deployment("web-server-01")`
5. Monitor and report: `check_deployment_status()`

### Issue Investigation
**User**: "Our infrastructure seems to have problems in production"

**Response Pattern**:
1. Immediate health check: `get_enhanced_infrastructure_status(environment="production")`
2. Visual assessment: `visualize_infrastructure(environment="production", visualization_type="tree")`
3. Check for drift: `check_drift(environment="production")`
4. Analyze recent changes: `get_audit_log()`
5. Provide remediation recommendations
